Optional Extras:

- Write code that will call .respond() many times with new events to see a sequence of turns.
- Write code that allows the car to accelerate or decelerate based on the event. You could make this another type that extends the Control type.
- Add more types of events so your car can do things like ‘emergencyBrake’ or ‘parallelPark’.
